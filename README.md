# mass-tracker
Tracks mass changes over time in kg, also plotting days of "feasts", mensturation and medication taken

Currently requires input of all period dates, medication dates and feast dates
Would like to make the inclusion of these optional, as well as the user creation of new inputs
-> will need to change structure to deal with objects for best results for these changes
